## Problem #1
```
# Problem 1: Suppose x = 1.1, a = 2.2, and b = 3.3. 
# Assign each expression to the value of the variable z
# and print the value stored in z
x <- 1.1
a <- 2.2
b <- 3.3

z <- x^a^b
print(z)
z <- (x^a)^b
print(z)
z <- 3*x^3+2*x^2+1
print(z)
```

## Problem #2
```
# Problem 2: Using the rep and seq functions, 
# create the following vectors.

z <- c(1:8,7:1)
print(z)

z <- c(1:5)
b <- rep(x=z,times=z)
print(b)

z <- c(5:1)
c <- rep(x=z,times=1:5)
print(c)
```

## Problem #3
```
# Problem 3: Create a vector of two random uniform numbers. 
# Using one of Râ€™s inverse trigonometry functions
#(asin(), acos(), or atan()), convert these numbers into polar 
# coordinates

z <- runif(2)
print(z)
r <- (z[1]^2+z[2]^2)^1/2
theta <- atan(z[2]/z[1])
polar_vec <- c(r,theta)
print(polar_vec)
```

## Problem #4
```
# Problem 4: Using R expressions, update the queue successively

queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant")
print(queue)

# the serpent arrives and gets in line;
queue[5] <- "serpent" 
print(queue)

# the sheep enters the ark;
queue <- queue[-c(1)]
print(queue)

# the donkey arrives and talks his way to the front of the line
queue <- c("donkey",queue[1:4])
print(queue)
               
# the serpent gets impatient and leaves;
queue <- c(queue[1:4])
print(queue)

# the owl gets bored and leaves;
queue <- c(queue[1:2],queue[4])
print(queue)

# the aphid arrives and the ant invites him to cut in line.
queue <- c(queue[1:2],"aphid",queue[3])
print(queue)

# Finally, determine the position of the aphid in the line.
which(queue=="aphid")
```

## Problem #5
```
# Problem 5: Use R to create a vector of all of the integers 
# from 1 to 100 that are not divisible by 2, 3, or 7.

x <- c(1:100)
print(x)
Filter(function(i) { all(i %% c(2,3,7) != 0) }, seq(100))
